# Sourced by the compare scripts: run 1git with git's own argument vector
# through the translation table in the program itself (`1git -migrate`), so the
# command line under test is the new grammar while the oracle (real git) is
# still asked in git's.
#
#   one_run <1git-binary> <git args...>
#
# runs `1git` with the rewritten line and leaves its stdout, stderr and exit
# status as they are. A git line that has no equivalent in the new command line
# (an option 1git dropped) cannot be typed to 1git any more, but the command
# function still takes it: the line goes to the program's internal
# git-grammar path (M31GIT_INTERNAL_ARGV=1, the one pull re-runs itself by), so
# the oracle keeps checking what the code behind the command line does. Those
# runs are counted in "$CLI_FALLBACKS" so a suite can say how many forms are not
# reachable from the command line.
#
#   norm_rc <status>
#
# prints 0 for 0 and 1 for anything else: 1git's exit status is 0 or 1 (2 for a
# command line it refuses), where git's is 0, 1, 2, 128, 129 ...
#
# Works with bash 3.2 (macOS): no mapfile, no `${arr[@]}` on an empty array
# under `set -u`.
