# mgit's modes

Since 0.25.0 `mgit` is five full-screen **modes**, not one screen with every
key bound at once. Each mode shows only what makes sense in it, the bottom row
lists only those keys, and `Tab` moves to the next mode.

```
 1 Status  2 Commit  3 History  4 Branches  5 Stash        <- the tab bar (row 1)
 main  ·  → origin/main ↑2  ·  +1 ~3 ?1  ·  repo           <- the statusline (row 2)
 ▾ Untracked files (1)
     notes.txt                                              <- the mode's body
 ▾ Unstaged changes (3)
     M  a.txt
 ...
 hunk 1 of a.txt staged                                     <- messages (dim)
 s stage  u unstage  d diff  c commit  Tab mode  : commands  ? more   <- the hint row (last row)
```

There is no border: the first row is the tab bar, the last row is the hint row,
and everything in between is the mode.

## Moving between modes

| key | does |
|---|---|
| `Tab` / `Shift-Tab` | the next / previous mode, wrapping round (an open diff is closed: it belongs to its mode) |
| `1` ... `5` | jump to a mode |
| `Esc` | from any mode but Status: back to Status. From Status: quit |
| `q` | quit (in a diff or an overlay: close it first) |
| a click on a tab | switch to it; the wheel and a click on a row work in every outline mode, as they always did in a diff |
| `:` or `Ctrl-P` | the command palette (below) |
| `?` | the help for the mode you are in (below) |

Each mode remembers where its cursor was (by row, not by position) and gives it
back when you return.

## The modes

Counts are generated, not typed: `tests/t_modes.m31` prints them (the `info:`
lines) from the same table. "action keys" are the keys that do something in the
mode (not movement, folding, search or the keys every mode shares); "hint row"
is the most the bottom row ever shows at once.

| mode | body | action keys | hint row |
|---|---|---|---|
| **1 Status** | untracked, unstaged and staged files; the hunk diff when you open one | 10 (8 in the diff) | 8 |
| **2 Commit** | what the commit will say and contain; amend; sign-off | 5 | 8 |
| **3 History** | the log, a commit's files, file history; reset and check out a commit | 10 | 8 |
| **4 Branches** | local branches, tags, delete, rename, merge, rebase, push and pull | 12 | 8 |
| **5 Stash** | the stash list, push, pop, apply, drop | 2 (plus the stash menu's own) | 6 |

Before, the one screen answered 57 keys at its top level (the outline's and the
everywhere keys, aliases counted), 20 of them actions, and on 80 columns the
footer ran out of room after about six. Now no mode has more than ten
action keys, none shows more than eight on the bottom row, and the rest are one
`?` away, grouped. The menus behind `b`, `m`, `r`, `z`, `P`, `F`, `T`, `A` and
`V` are unchanged; they are overlays with their own small key sets.

### 1 Status: review and stage

Untracked, unstaged and staged changes (the first three sections of the old
outline, in the same order). A conflict list ("Unmerged paths") appears here
while a merge, cherry-pick or rebase has conflicts.

| key | does |
|---|---|
| `s` / `u` | stage / unstage the file under the cursor |
| `S` / `U` | stage everything / unstage everything |
| `x` | discard the file's changes (asks first, naming the path) |
| `d` or `Enter` on a file | open its hunk diff |
| `c` | go to the Commit mode |
| `B` / `H` | blame / history of the file |
| `Enter` | fold or unfold the section; on an unmerged path open the resolution view |
| `Space`, `-`, `+` | fold the row's section, fold every section, unfold every section |
| `[` `]` `{` `}`, `j` `k`, `h` `l` | move between sections and rows, scroll sideways |
| `/` `n` `N` | search |
| `J` `w` | the jump list, and giving it the keys |

In the diff view (`d`): `s` / `u` stage or unstage the hunk under the cursor,
`v` selects lines (`Space` or `Enter` stages them, `x` discards them, asking
first), `D` toggles side-by-side, `f` folds a hunk, `-` / `+` fold or unfold
every hunk, `[` `]` move between hunks, `{` `}` between files, `h` `l` `e` `E`
`w` `<` `>` drive the side-by-side view, `q` or `Esc` or `Backspace` goes back.

### 2 Commit: write and make the commit

A panel, not a list: the heading says whether it is a new commit, an amend or a
merge commit, then the first line of the draft message and the staged files.
git keeps `COMMIT_EDITMSG` after every commit, so a file that is a leftover is not
a draft: one older than HEAD's reflog (HEAD has moved since it was written), or one
with the reflog's own timestamp that says what HEAD's own commit says, shows as `(none yet: e to write one)`, is
not what `f` commits (it refuses an empty message), and `e` starts again from the
template. An amend's prefilled message is a draft, and so is a message newer than
the last commit that repeats it. (With no reflog for HEAD, `core.logAllRefUpdates=false`,
there is no order to go by and nothing is treated as a leftover.)

| key | does |
|---|---|
| `e` | write the message in `$EDITOR`; leaving the editor with a message makes the commit |
| `f` | make the commit from the message already on disk |
| `A` | amend HEAD: its message is prefilled, its parents and author are kept |
| `a` | discard the draft (and the amend), after asking and naming what goes: `discard the draft message "fix the parser"?` (`y` discards, any other key keeps it) |
| `s` | sign-off on or off: add a `Signed-off-by:` trailer to the commit (below) |

After a commit the client returns to Status. `c` in Status is the same as
pressing `2`, plus a refusal while a cherry-pick, revert or rebase is under way.

#### Sign-off

`s` is a switch, not a one-off action, because the message is written in
`$EDITOR` and the commit is made when the editor closes: the switch says what
will happen to the message then. It does what `git commit -s` does, and nothing
more:

* **Off by default**, so no commit is ever signed by surprise. The panel says
  `Sign-off  off (s adds a Signed-off-by trailer)`; switched on it shows the
  exact line that will be added, `Sign-off  ON: Signed-off-by: Name <email>`,
  and the hint row has `s sign-off` in either state.
* **Who**: the committer identity, which is what git uses: `GIT_COMMITTER_NAME`
  and `_EMAIL`, else `user.name` and `user.email`.
* **Where**: after the message's last trailer block when it ends in one
  (`Reviewed-by:`, another `Signed-off-by:`, `Co-authored-by:`), otherwise after
  a blank line. The subject line alone is never taken for a trailer block.
* **Never twice**: when the same `Signed-off-by:` line is already the last line
  or anywhere in the last trailer block, nothing is added. Someone else's
  sign-off does not count: yours is added after it.
* It applies to every commit made while it is on, amends and merge commits
  included, and stays on for the session (`s` again turns it off).
* **`mgit.signoff`**: `git config mgit.signoff true` makes it start on (any git
  boolean; absent or off is the default). Only the starting state is
  configurable; the key still switches it.

The draft file is never changed: the trailer is added to the message that is
committed, so what `e` shows is what you wrote.

### 3 History: the log

The commits section: `Enter` unfolds a commit (author, date, message, files
changed); `Enter` on one of its files opens that commit's diff of the file.

| key | does |
|---|---|
| `Enter` | unfold or fold; on a commit's file open its diff (so does `d`); on the last row load more commits |
| `A` / `V` | cherry-pick / revert the commit under the cursor (menu: now, `-x`, `-n`, keep empty, a range, merge parent) |
| `r` | the rebase menu: onto a branch, interactively, `h` from the commit under the cursor, `--onto`, autosquash, autostash |
| `Z` | undo the last HEAD move from the reflog (shows it, asks first); `r` redo |
| `G` | reset the current branch to the commit under the cursor: a menu of `s` soft, `m` mixed, `h` hard (below) |
| `o` | check the commit out with a detached HEAD (`git checkout --detach`) |
| `B` / `H` | blame / history of a commit's file |
| the movement, fold and search keys of Status | |

The diff of a commit's file has the same read-only keys as Status's diff
(side-by-side, folds, hunks, files); stage and discard are Status's.

`G` and `o` act on the commit under the cursor (or on the commit a file row
belongs to). Neither is in the hint row, which is full; `?` and the palette list
them. Both wait while a merge, cherry-pick, revert or rebase is under way and
say why (`reset is blocked while CHERRY-PICKING (A or V: continue, skip or abort)`).

* **Reset** is `git reset --soft|--mixed|--hard <commit>`: the branch HEAD is on
  (or HEAD itself when it is detached) moves to the commit, `ORIG_HEAD` is set
  to where it was, and the reflog says `reset: moving to <commit>`. *Soft* moves
  nothing else. *Mixed* also makes the index the commit's tree; the files keep
  their changes. *Hard* also makes the files the commit's tree. Untracked files
  stay in all three. Soft and mixed run at once; **hard asks first**, and the
  question names what it throws away: `Discards the uncommitted changes to 2
  tracked files: a.txt, s.txt, for good. Moves main off 1 commit (Z undoes the
  move). Untracked files stay.` `y` does it, any other key changes nothing.
  `Z` brings the branch back after a reset; it cannot bring back file changes.
* **Check out** (`o`) is `git checkout --detach <commit>`: HEAD is left on the
  commit, no branch moves, and the status line shows `detached @ 1a2b3c4`
  afterwards. It refuses, changing nothing, where git refuses: a file the
  checkout would change has local changes (`check out refused: a.txt has local
  changes (HEAD stays)`), or an untracked file is in
  the way (`check out refused: an untracked file is in the way of s.txt (HEAD
  stays)`); either way the message names the file. Changes to
  files the two commits do not differ in are carried along, as git carries them.
  `b` then `c` / Enter in Branches gets you back on a branch.

### 4 Branches: branches, tags and the remote

Local branches, the current one starred, with ahead and behind.

| key | does |
|---|---|
| `Enter` | switch to the branch under the cursor (refused with the reason when a file is in the way) |
| `b` | the branch menu: `c` switch, `/` pick by typing, `n` new from HEAD, `r` a remote branch (a tracking branch is made) |
| `m` | the merge menu: fast-forward when possible, always a merge commit, fast-forward only; continue or abort while merging |
| `r` | the rebase menu (as in History) |
| `A` / `V` | cherry-pick / revert the branch's tip |
| `F` | the pull menu: pull, fetch, pull on the terminal with git's rules, pull with rebase |
| `P` | the push menu: push, push and set the upstream, push on the terminal |
| `T` | tags: list, create (lightweight or annotated), delete |
| `D` | delete the branch under the cursor if it is merged, as `git branch -d` does; otherwise refused, saying into what it is not merged |
| `X` | force-delete it (`git branch -D`), after a question that says whether it is merged and how to get it back (`git branch NAME <old tip>`) |
| `e` | rename it (`git branch -m`): a prompt starting from the current name |

The three are in the help (`?`) and the palette, not the hint row, which is
already full. What they refuse, and why:

* **The branch you are on** is never deleted (`cannot delete main: it is the
  branch you are on`), nor is one checked out in another work tree. Switch away first.
* **`D`** keeps a branch whose tip is not reachable from its upstream (when it
  has one that exists) or from HEAD: `cannot delete wip: not fully merged into
  HEAD (main)`. Nothing is changed. `X` is the way to throw it away.
* Deleting removes the ref (loose and packed), the directories it leaves
  empty, the branch's reflog and its `branch.<name>.*` configuration, as git does.
* **`e`** checks the name with git's `check-ref-format` rules (no space, `~ ^ :
  ? * [ \`, no `..` or `@{`, no leading `-` or `.`, no trailing `/`, `.` or
  `.lock`, or `HEAD`; a lone `@` is fine, as for git) and says so when it fails. A name that already
  exists is not replaced unless you confirm (`git branch -M`): the question
  names the branch that would go; a name that is a checked-out branch is
  refused outright. The reflog and configuration move with the branch, and
  renaming the current branch moves HEAD with it.
* All of them wait while a merge, cherry-pick, revert or rebase is under way
  (`delete branch is blocked while MERGING (m c continues, m a aborts)`).

### 5 Stash: the stash list

The stashes, newest first (the section is there even when empty).

| key | does |
|---|---|
| `z` | the stash menu: push, with untracked files, keeping the index, with a message; pop, apply, apply with `--index`, drop (asks first), branch from the stash, list |
| `Enter` on a stash | the stash list over that stash, with its diff beside it (`p` pop, `a` apply, `d` drop, `D` side-by-side) |

## Flows: merge, cherry-pick, revert, rebase

A flow is a state, not a mode. While one is under way:

* the status line names it in red (`REBASING 2/3`, `CHERRY-PICKING (1 conflict)`,
  `MERGING`) and, when nothing else is being said, the message row repeats it
  with the key that gets you out, in every mode;
* **the way out leads the hint row in every mode**: `A/V cherry-pick / revert:
  continue, skip, abort`, `r rebase: continue, skip, abort, edit`, `m merge:
  continue or abort`. Those keys work from any mode, and open the flow's own
  small menu (continue, skip, abort, quit, edit the todo list);
* the actions that would fight it are not advertised (commit, branch, merge,
  pull, undo, rebase, cherry-pick and revert from idle) and, when you press one
  anyway, are refused with one line that says why: `commit is blocked while
  CHERRY-PICKING (A or V: continue, skip or abort)`. From a mode that does not
  have the key, the refusal still says why rather than only where the key
  went. A merge in progress still allows committing: that is how it finishes;
* the conflict list, the resolution view and the rebase todo editor are the
  overlays they always were, with their own keys.

## The hint row

The last row, dim, one line, left-aligned. It shows the keys of the current
mode, view (a diff open or not) and state (a flow or not), most likely first;
on a narrow terminal the least likely go first and `? more` is always kept.
Width is measured in display columns (a wide character is two), so a CJK label
never overflows. An overlay shows its own keys instead (without `? more`: its
keys are all of them).

## `?`: the help

The keys of the mode you are in, grouped (the mode's own actions first, then
movement, folding and search, then the keys every mode shares), and below them
"every menu and view the keys above open": the reference of each menu's keys.
`j` / `k` scroll; `Esc`, `q` or `?` close.

## `:` / `Ctrl-P`: the command palette

A fuzzy picker over every action of every mode, written `Branches: switch to the
branch   [Enter]`, with the key to press next time. Typing filters (a lower-case
query ignores case); `Enter` runs it: it switches to the action's mode and does
it, exactly as its key would. Also in the palette: `Go to <mode>` for each mode.
The cursor-movement keys are not listed (nobody looks them up). An action whose
binding has no key is listed too, as `[no key]`, and runs the same way.

## Keys that moved

Keys keep their letters. A key that is bound but belongs to another mode says
so instead of doing nothing: `A moved to History (3): cherry-pick. Tab or 3 goes
there; : lists every command`. The full sentence is shown the first time a key
is pressed, once and for all: the keys already told about are kept in
`$XDG_STATE_HOME/m31git/notified` (`~/.local/state/m31git/notified`), one name per
line, written whole to a temporary file and renamed over the old one. A directory
that cannot be written only means the sentence comes again. After the first time
it is the short form (`A: History (3)`). `M31GIT_STATE=off` reads and writes
nothing (the tests set it). A key
that is simply absent from a panel (a movement key in the Commit panel) says
nothing. This notice is meant for one release; the table row that drives it is
`GIT_ui_keymap.moved_to`.

Two keys changed their meaning rather than their place, because `Tab` is now the
mode key and `Esc` backs out:

| before | now |
|---|---|
| `Tab` folds the row (outline) / hunk (diff) | `Space` folds the row; `f` folds a hunk |
| `Esc` quits from the outline | `Esc` goes to Status; from Status it quits |
| `c` opened a commit overlay | `c` goes to the Commit mode; `e` `f` `A` `a` are the same, `Esc` no longer discards the draft (`a` does) |
| the footer listed the base keys | the hint row lists the mode's keys; `?` the rest |

## How it is built

Three tables, one source:

* `GIT_ui_core.key_table()` binds a key to a command id within a scope. It is
  the only place a key letter appears.
* `GIT_ui_keymap.entries()` says, for each mode (`modes`), view (`doc`, `diff`)
  and flow state (`when`), which `(scope, cmd)` is offered, under what `label`,
  in which help `group` and at what hint `priority` (0: help and palette only).
  The hint row, `?`, the palette and the dispatcher read it, so there is no
  second copy.
* `GIT_ui_modes` holds the pure facts: the order of the modes, which outline
  sections a mode shows, the tab bar for a width.

The library side of the four ref actions is in `core/`: `GIT_branches.delete_branch`,
`rename_branch` (with `is_valid_branch_name`, `merge_state`, `is_checked_out`),
`GIT_checkout.reset` (`ResetMode` soft, mixed, hard) and `checkout` with an empty
target ref for the detached case; the command line's `-branch --delete` and
`--rename` run on the same functions. The UI half is `ui/GIT_ui_actions.m31`.

A keypress with no overlay open goes: scopes for the mode (`GIT_ui_keymap.scopes_for`)
-> key table lookup -> `GIT_ui_keymap.find` for the mode, view and state ->
`State.run_in_mode`. No entry means "moved to" (or a flow refusal); an entry
whose state does not match still runs, so the operation's own refusal speaks.

### How to add an action

1. Bind the key in `GIT_ui_core.key_table()` (a `Binding` in `SCOPE_OUTLINE`,
   `SCOPE_DIFF`, `SCOPE_COMMIT` or `SCOPE_GLOBAL`) with a `CMD_*` constant.
2. Add an `Entry` to `GIT_ui_keymap.entries()`: the modes it belongs to, the
   view, the same scope and command, a short label, a group, a hint priority
   (leave 0 unless it is among the mode's eight most likely actions), and `when:`
   "idle" if a flow must stop it.
3. Run it: add the `cmd` to `State.run_outline_command`, `run_diff_command` or
   `run_commit_command` in `ui/GIT_client.m31`.
4. `bash tests/test_modes.sh`-style checks (`tests/t_modes.m31`) tell you if a key
   is bound twice in a mode, if a binding is offered by no mode, if the palette
   cannot reach it, or if a hint row overflows.

## Rendering

The screen is rebuilt every frame and drawn as a difference from the last one,
so one stray cell stays wrong until something repaints it. Two things
corrupted cells before this release and are fixed here:

* **Control characters.** `TUI_buffer.set_str` keeps a zero-width character
  inside the cell before it, and that includes a tab, CR or ESC. The diff then
  sent it to the terminal raw: a tab in a diffed file jumped to its tab stop
  and every cell written after it landed in the wrong column, so a later
  update left old cells behind. File text, names, branch names and commit
  messages now go through `GIT_sbs.printable` / `visible` (tabs expanded,
  controls shown as U+2400 symbols, as the side-by-side view already did), and
  `GIT_ui_scrub.scrub` removes any control character left in a cell of the
  finished frame, whatever put it there.
* Nothing is written past a row's width: every `set_str` has a `max`, and every
  string is cut with `TUI_text` (display columns, not bytes).

`tests/pty_modes.py` is the check (and, for the four ref actions and the
sign-off, a comparison with the local `git`: each runs beside an identical twin
repository that git itself changes, and refs, reflogs, index, files and
configuration are compared; where git refuses mgit must refuse and change
nothing): at 80x24, 120x40 and 40x12 it tours every
mode (plus unified and side-by-side diffs, a commit's files, the stash list,
help and the palette) over a repository of wide, emoji, combining-mark, tabbed
and very long names, and after each step asserts that the tab bar and hint row
are where they should be, that nothing is drawn past the last column (the same
bytes are fed to a terminal 40 columns wider), and that the screen equals a full
repaint (the terminal is resized and put back, and the two screens compared
cell by cell, style included). It needs `pyte`; without it the checks are
skipped.

### The loop, and what it asks of the terminal

Since 0.28.0 mgit runs on tui's own loop (`TUI_app.Loop.run_with`); the private copy
it used to run (`GIT_ui_loop.run`) is gone. `ui/GIT_ui_app.m31` has what the loop is
given (`App`: the frame, the key handler and the idle ticker) and every setting
(`make_loop`, tested by `tests/t_loop.m31`). What is the same as before, and checked
byte for byte against 0.27.1 under a pty (see the CHANGELOG): one frame per key or
mouse report, the first frame and every resized one written in full, the rest as a
diff against the frame before; mouse reports asked for with the same modes (wheel
and clicks, no motion) and handled by mgit's own hit testing, not routed by the loop;
no paste, focus or keyboard mode is asked for; the terminal is given back before
`$EDITOR` runs and taken again after it; a lone Escape (or a held start of an escape
sequence) waits 250 ms for more input, whatever the idle timer does (`Loop.escape_wait_ms`,
tui 0.12.0). One difference, in time only: the idle ticker runs from the loop's timer.

What is new is `--sync on|off|auto`: synchronized output (DEC mode 2026). The
terminal is asked once (DECRQM) when mgit starts and frames go between the markers
only after it answered that it has the mode, so a terminal that does not know it
never sees them. `auto`, the default, asks every terminal except Terminal.app (it
prints queries it does not know) and a dumb one (`TERM` unset, `dumb`, `linux`,
`vt100`, `ansi`); `on` asks whatever the terminal is; `off` writes the bytes of 0.27.1.
The idle ticker (the repository polled about once a second, see `GIT_ui_autorefresh`)
runs from the loop's timer, every 250 ms; a tick that follows a key does not
count as idle, so the polling still happens only while nothing is typed.
