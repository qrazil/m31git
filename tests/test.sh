# --no-delta-base-offset` (repack does not honour `pack.deltaBaseOffset` the
# same way; asking `pack-objects` directly does) is real `OBJ_REF_DELTA`
# instead, still against bases in the one pack, which is what proves the
# in-`.idx` fast path in `GIT_pack.m31`'s own `resolve_offset` and not only its
# cross-pack/loose fallback. The new pack has to be written *before* the old
# one is removed -- `pack-objects` reads the objects it is packing from
